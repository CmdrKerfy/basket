[BOSTWANA CASE STUDY](/_posts/articles/OSM for Malaria Eradication_PeaceCorpsBotswana.pdf)

A brief case study written by Peace Corps' Mike Banfield and Theresa Govert, currently stationed in Botswana. The Peace Corps worked with volunteers from the local health clinic to use GPS devices, OSM and QGIS to analyze the effectiveness of a malaria prevention campaign. 

This is a model case for how Peace Corps volunteers and their communities can take advantage of GIS tools to make data-driven project decisions.
